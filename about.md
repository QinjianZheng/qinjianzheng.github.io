Hey there! Thank you for taking the time to know a little about me. I'm Qinjian Zheng, currently working on my Master's degree in Information Technology at University of New South Wales in Australia. I have immersed in study of computer science for about half a year. Prior to this, I had been a business student for nearly six years. I think I finally figured out what I want to do with my life.

This is my third week into **web front-end programming** and I love it! The reason I started this website is that I want to put my learning in the class to use, do something nice and pretty and build a cozy place for myself to share my thoughts. In addition, a lot of time I encountered some problems, I googled them, I solved them and I forgot about them, next time they would come back and bite me again. Also, I hope whoever comes to my website will find the stuff I wrote and noted helpful.

If not for COVID, I would be in Australia with my girlfriend right now, studying with fellow classmates about all the fascinating stuff about computer science, instead of sitting in my apartment alone, not seeing another soul for a week.

I hope this difficult period will pass soon, and wish you a very good day.
