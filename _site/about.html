      <h2>About me</h2>
<h5><i>07 Jul 2021</i></h5>

<p>Hey there! Thank you for taking the time to know a little about me. I’m Qinjian Zheng, currently working on my Master’s degree in Information Technology at University of New South Wales in Australia. I have immersed in study of computer science for almost a year. Prior to this, I had been a business student for nearly six years. I think I finally figured out what I want to do with my life.</p>

<p>The reason I started this website is that I want to put my learning in the class to use, do something nice and pretty and build a cozy place for myself to share my thoughts. In addition, a lot of time I encountered some problems, I googled them, I solved them and I forgot about them, next time they would come back and bite me again. Also, I hope whoever comes to my website will find the stuff I wrote and noted helpful.</p>

<p>It has been 5 months since I started my <strong>web front-end programming</strong> journey! I have grown a lot during this time in terms of knowledge about front-end programming and also general programming as a whole. I think I become more like a professional programmer. Just a week ago, I started my internship as a front-end programmer at Alibaba which is my first job in the Internet industry. People are nice and whole environment is tolerant to a beginner like myself to learn and grow. But I am expecting to be more of use to the team later this month when I land my feet.</p>

<p>The whole world is in lockdown as COVID period continues, in someplace more than others. I miss my girlfriend who is currently in Australia while I am on the other side of Pacific Ocean. Even though I haven’t seen her in a year and a half, we stay in touch as much as possible through Internet and we stay strong during this difficult time.</p>

<p>Things are better in China than in other parts of the world, I am glad. Hope we can beat the virus soon, and wish you all a very good day.</p>
